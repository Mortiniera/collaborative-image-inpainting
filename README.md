Sampling results for image inpainting by targeting the corrupted region. (Top) Input data with masked region(second row) Output of the generator surrounded by itscontext image (third row) Heatmap highlighting visualdifferences between the inpainted output of thegenerator in the 2nd row and the refined results in thefourth row. The closer to the red, the higher thedifferences (fourth row) refined samples after applyingcollaborative sampling and discriminator shapingsurrounded by its context image (bottom) Originalimages.
